# Requirements which are indirectly needed for various reasons.
# That is, they are not imported by our code.
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# At the time of writing, with the latest versions of the DC/OS E2E direct
# dependencies, there is a version conflict for ``msrestazure``, an
# indirect dependency.
# Therefore, we pin a particular version which satisfies all requirements.
# See DCOS-40131.
msrestazure==0.4.34
# Without the following, some users get:
# The 'secretstorage' distribution was not found and is required by keyring
SecretStorage==3.1.0
# Requirements from DC/OS Launch
azure-common==1.1.15
azure-mgmt-network==2.2.1
azure-mgmt-resource==2.0.0
