Usage: dcos-docker run [OPTIONS] NODE_ARGS...

  Run an arbitrary command on a node.

  This command sets up the environment so that ``pytest`` can be run.

  For example, run ``dcos-docker run --cluster-id 1231599 pytest -k
  test_tls.py``.

  Or, with sync: ``dcos-docker run --sync-dir . --cluster-id 1231599 pytest -k
  test_tls.py``.

  To use special characters such as single quotes in your command, wrap the
  whole command in double quotes.

Options:
  -c, --cluster-id TEXT          The ID of the cluster to use.  [default:
                                 default]
  --dcos-login-uname TEXT        The username to set the ``DCOS_LOGIN_UNAME``
                                 environment variable to.
  --dcos-login-pw TEXT           The password to set the ``DCOS_LOGIN_PW``
                                 environment variable to.
  --sync-dir PATH                The path to a DC/OS checkout. Part of this
                                 checkout will be synced to all master nodes
                                 before the command is run.
  --no-test-env                  With this flag set, no environment variables
                                 are set and the command is run in the home
                                 directory.
  --node TEXT                    A reference to a particular node to run the
                                 command on. This can be one of: The node's IP
                                 address, the node's Docker container name, the
                                 node's Docker container ID, a reference in the
                                 format "<role>_<number>". These details be seen
                                 with ``dcos-docker inspect``.
  --env TEXT                     Set environment variables in the format
                                 "<KEY>=<VALUE>"
  --transport [docker-exec|ssh]  The communication transport to use. On macOS
                                 the SSH transport requires IP routing to be set
                                 up. See "dcos-docker setup-mac-network".It also
                                 requires the "ssh" command to be available.
                                 This can be provided by setting the
                                 `DCOS_DOCKER_TRANSPORT` environment
                                 variable.When using a TTY, different transports
                                 may use different line endings.  [default:
                                 docker-exec]
  -v, --verbose                  Use verbose output. Use this option multiple
                                 times for more verbose output.
  --help                         Show this message and exit.
