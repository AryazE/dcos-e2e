Usage: dcos-docker destroy-list [OPTIONS] [CLUSTER_IDS]...

  Destroy clusters.

  To destroy all clusters, run ``dcos-docker destroy $(dcos-docker list)``.

Options:
  --transport [docker-exec|ssh]  The communication transport to use. On macOS
                                 the SSH transport requires IP routing to be set
                                 up. See "dcos-docker setup-mac-network". It
                                 also requires the "ssh" command to be
                                 available. This can be provided by setting the
                                 `DCOS_DOCKER_TRANSPORT` environment variable.
                                 When using a TTY, different transports may use
                                 different line endings.  [default: docker-exec]
  --help                         Show this message and exit.
