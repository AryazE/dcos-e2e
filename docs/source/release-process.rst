Performing a Release
--------------------

#. Clone DC/OS E2E:

   .. code:: sh

      git clone git@github.com:mesosphere/dcos-e2e.git

#. Choose a new version:

   This should be todayâ€™s date in the format ``YYYY.MM.DD.MICRO``.
   ``MICRO`` should refer to the number of releases created on this date, starting from ``0``.

   .. code:: sh

       export DCOS_E2E_RELEASE=2017.06.15.0

#. Create a release branch:

   .. code:: sh

       git fetch origin
       git checkout -b release-$DCOS_E2E_RELEASE origin/master

#. Add changes in the new release to ``CHANGELOG.rst``.

   Do not add a change note which says that this updates the tool to work with the latest version of DC/OS OSS or DC/OS Enterprise, as this is implied.
   If this is the only change, add an empty entry to the changelog.

#. Commit and push changes.

   .. code:: sh

       git commit -am "Bump version to $DCOS_E2E_RELEASE"
       git push

#. Create a Pull Request to merge the ``release`` branch into ``master``.

#. Merge the ``release`` Pull Request once CI has passed.

#. Tag a release:

   Visit https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-e2e/releases/new.
   Set the "Tag version" to the new version.
   Choose "master" as the target.
   Add the changes from the changelog to the release description.
