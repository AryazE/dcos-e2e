Docker Backend
==============

Requirements
------------

-  Docker

Plenty of memory must be given to Docker.
On Docker for Mac, this can be done from Docker > Preferences > Advanced.
This backend has been tested with a four node cluster with 9 GB memory given to Docker.

-  IP routing set up for Docker

On Docker for Mac this requires a tool such as `docker-mac-network <https://github.com/wojas/docker-mac-network>`__.

-  ``ssh``
