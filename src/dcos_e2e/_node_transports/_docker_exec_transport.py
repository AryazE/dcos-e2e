            log_output_live: If ``True``, log output live. If ``True``, stderr
                is merged into stdout in the return value.
            env: Environment variables to be set on the node before running

            shell: If ``False`` (the default), each argument is passed as a

                including whitespace.
            tty: If ``True``, allocate a pseudo-tty. This means that the users
                terminal is attached to the streams of the process.
                This means that the values of stdout and stderr will not be in
                the returned ``subprocess.CompletedProcess``.
            ssh_key_path: The path to an SSH key which can be used to SSH to
