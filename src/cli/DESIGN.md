## Interface ideas

### doctor

Tells you about e.g. RAM and Docker for Mac network issues.

## sync

Syncs bootstrap and tests


### Enterprise ideas

Handle custom CA cert?
Sync different integration tests?

## Misc ideas

Customisable logging system (wait?)

Are dangling volumes left

test run on OSS
does OSS boot?

Maybe docker-machine like - without name is 'default' then you never need the name - uses `default` everywhere
